# [rust-qm-demo](https://github.com/npny/rust-qm-demo)

A little toy project I made for learning Rust.  
The experimental setup is a single right-moving electron wavepacket passing through an hydrogen atom potential well.

Red is the _real field component_, blue is the _imaginary field component_, white is _higher potential energy_, and black is _lower potential energy_.  

Lower the timescale for better stability, or fiddle with the fundamental constants and see what comes out!
